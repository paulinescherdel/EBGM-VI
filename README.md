This code repository is associated with the publication "A big-data approach to producing descriptive anthropometric references: a feasibility and validation study of paediatric growth charts" (DOI: 10.1016/S2589-7500(19)30149-9)

The code allow:
- to apply a data-cleaning process to growth data based on extreme absolute z-score, duplicated, and extreme variation z-score (cleaning.r)
- to model height growth charts using the LMS method (height modelling.r)
